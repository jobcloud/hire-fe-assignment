## Hire FE Assignment

Oh God, a test like in school! Please don't lose your courage. The tasks include topics that are important to us. Even if you don't solve everything one hundred percent, it helps us to understand what makes you tick. You would solve something differently if you had more time? Mention it. You have lost a lot of time on a certain topic. Mention it. Solving the tasks gives us a starting point to get into the technical conversation. Even if you only have answers to part of the exercises, you are still in the race!

### Tasks

Your take-home assignment consists of 6 different tasks that can be found in the `tasks` folder. In each subfolder, you'll find the `index.ts` file with code and `INDEX.md` with questions and instructions on what needs to be done. The tasks can be done in any order you want, they are not dependent on each other.

### Constraints

- This assignment has been designed to be solved within 3-5 hours.
- Your answers need to be in the dedicated `INDEX.md` file for each task.
- Refactored code needs to be in the `index.ts` file for each task.
- You will provide your solution as a zip (zip the folder) as an email attachment.
- You will send the archive to `marko.stanimirovic@jobcloud.ch` and `marko.ilic@jobcloud.ch`.
- This assignment will be a starting point for the discussion at the technical interview.

Good Luck!
